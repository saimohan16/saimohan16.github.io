**Greetings, newcomer (or returning visitor)!** Welcome to my website. My name is Sai Mohan Gajapaka, and I am a Masterâ€™s student in Data Science at Michigan State University (MSU). I specialize in applying foundation models and advanced segmentation techniques to real-world drone imagery, focusing on achieving high accuracy with limited data. Currently, I am working under the guidance of  [Dr.Surya S.C Congress](https://engineering.msu.edu/faculty/Surya-SC-Congress) on focused research to monitor the structural health of infrastructures over time.

Feel free to explore my [publications](publications) and [Resume](cv). Below is a brief explanation of my journey as a researcher in both academic and industry settings

Previously, I worked at [CVIT](http://cvit.iiit.ac.in), IIIT-Hyderabad, where I developed interactive segmentation techniques to improve the accuracy of medical image analysis. From 2021 to 2022 I was part of [PureCodeAI](https://purecode.ai) as a Deep Learning Researcher. Here, I worked on developing object detection models to improve web component detection and streamline machine learning workflows. By creating a custom tree data structure, I mapped the spatial hierarchy of these components for better layout analysis. Additionally, I used LLMs to seamlessly convert layout descriptions into accurate HTML and CSS.

My journey began with a B.Tech in Information Technology from VNR VJIET, where I first explored the intersection of AI and healthcare. I was advised by [Dr.Nimmala Mangathayaru](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=djgiAekAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Dr.G Madhu](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?hl=en&user=cOgRevQAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate). I developed frameworks for cardiovascular disease diagnosis using real-time PPG and ECG data, and enhanced plant disease identification with bilinear convolutions. Additionally, I worked on improving CNN performance for malaria parasite detection in microscopic images. 

**Personal Interersts** - 
I enjoy listening to good music, watching anime, and playing a variety of gamesâ€”whether it's board games or video games. I also love racket sports like tennis, table tennis, and badminton. A good movie night is always a treat, and I'm always up for trying new foods. Meeting new people is something I look forward to, as it brings fresh and interesting experiences.

ðŸš€ Open to internship opportunities for Summer/Fall 2025. I'll be graduating in May 2025 and looking for full-time roles after that. If limited/complex data is your challenge, Iâ€™ve got the experience in building neural networks and handling tough datasets to get you the results you need. Feel free to reach outâ€”let's see how we can work together!
